    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>Built with HTML5 and CSS3, hosted on GitHub Pages, and designed with accessibility and clarity in mind. Development was done using Visual Studio Code, which supported efficient coding and version control through Git commits. Browser inspection tools were used to troubleshoot layout and styling issues, and the Live Server extension in VS Code provided real-time previews during development.</p>
