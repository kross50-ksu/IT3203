# The Changing Face of the Web

This project explores the evolution of websites, from static HTML pages in the early 1990s to immersive, intelligent platforms powered by modern frameworks and cloud infrastructure. It was created as part of the IT3203 Web Development course at Kennesaw State University.

## Project Overview

The site traces the history of web development, highlights key technologies and design trends, and looks ahead to the future of digital experiences. It is built using semantic HTML and styled with responsive CSS to reflect both technical accuracy and visual clarity.

## Site Structure

The website includes the following pages:

- `index.html` – Homepage with abstract, key terms, and table of contents
- `history.html` – The birth of the website and early web technologies
- `evolution.html` – Rise of design, interactivity, and Web 2.0
- `trends.html` – Modern frameworks, SPAs, PWAs, and future trends
- `concepts.html` – Definitions of key web development concepts
- `resources.html` – References and external learning resources
- `about.html` – Author bio and project background

## Assets
- All images are stored in the `/images/` folder. 
- Styles are managed through `/css/index.css`.
- Images & videos were AI generated using Adobe Firefly
